# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Purpose
We were approached by Pewlett Hackard executives to analyze their current prospects regarding the oncoming wave of retirements in their aging workforce. They are worried about the number of employees that are approaching retirement age, and tasked us with finding the number of positions in each department that would need to be refilled. 

##Results

- We found that there were over 70,000 positions that will need to be filled in the near future, based on the number of employees in each department who are at retirement age. 
- The vast majority of these individuals are Senior Engineers or Senior Staff, with the two categories making up over 50,000 of the retiring population. 
- The new or promoted employees that fill these vacancies will need to be trained. There are 1,549 current employees that are within ten years of retirement who would be excellent candidates for mentorship, due to their existing experience in the company. 
- Even if 100% of the staff that are eligible for mentorship accept and succeed in the mentorship program, They will each need to mentor nearly seventy mentees to fully replace the retiring population.

##Summary

As shown in the data above, PH will need to replace 72,48 retiring employees in the near future. With a population of 1,549 mentor-age employees ready to train up the up-and-coming generation on PH workers, each of those mentors will need to be responsible for approximately 70 mentees in order to train enough replacements for the jobs to all be adequately filled.
An additional concern would be whether the mentors available are in proper departments to mentor the upcoming employees. As seen in the image below
